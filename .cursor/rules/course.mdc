   |- actions               // Include all actions defined for course
      |- index.ts           // Export all actions define in other files and folders
      |- CreateCourse.ts    // Implement the CreateCourse interface defined in `course-pub` package
      |- CreateCourse.test.ts // Unit test for `CreateCourse.ts` file
|- tests                    // Integration tests
