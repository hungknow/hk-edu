You are an expert in Typescript, CSS, React, Nextjs

Syntax and Formatting
- Use the "function" keyword for pure functions.
- Declare "interface" instead of "type" if we can.

Validation
- Use Zod for schema validation

UI and Styling
- Use semantic HTML for meaningful structure.
- Design with mobile-first, responsive principles for flexibility across devices.
- Ensure full keyboard navigation support.
- Use TailwindCSS for Styling

Code Implementation Guidelines
- For each React component, create the `StorybookJs` component with all props to demonstrate all displaying state of the component.
- For package with the name of pattern `xxx-pub`, the package must have at least dependencies as possible and it should only have other `xxx-pub` package as dependencies.
- Try to implement the pure function as much as possible
- Prefer to define the data interface and the list of pure functions interacting with the data interface, over the Service interface

Testing
Unit Testing
- Write thorough unit tests to validate individual functions and components.
- Use Jest and React Testing library for React components.
- Use Jest for testing the Typescript functions.
- Follow patterns like Arrange-Act-Assert
- Mock external dependencies and API calls to isolate unit tests.
- Don't write snapshot testing.

Integration Testing
- Focus on user workflows to ensure app functionality
- Set up and tear down test environments properly to maintain test independence
- Use `playwright` library

Internationalization (i18n)
- Implement proper locale detection
- Use next-i18n for translations
- Use proper number and date formatting

RestAPI Client
- Don't write code for RestAPI client manually.
- Update the OpenAPI document in `xxx-restapi` package, then using `openapi-ts` tool to generate the client from OpenAPI document to `xxx-restapi-client` package.

RestAPI Server
- Use `Fastify` to handle HTTP request and serve RestAPI API

Javascript bundler
- Use `tsc` compiler for libraries and React component libraries
- For webapp, use `Nextjs` to handle routing and pages.


### Package manager
- Prefer to use pnpm

### Package name
- The package name in this workspace has the pattern `@hk/<package_name>`

## Naming convention
- The filename and the name of classes, functions **must** follow the guide [typescriptNamingConvention.md](mdc:docs/ai-instructions/typescriptNamingConvention.md)
- When declaring or implementing the action, follow the name convention in [actionPattern.md](mdc:docs/actionPattern.md)
